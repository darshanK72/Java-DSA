Is it a resource allocation problem? (rooms, platforms, etc.)
├── Yes → Use Priority Queue or Chronological Ordering
│   ├── If need to track multiple resources → Priority Queue
│   └── If need to track start/end times separately → Chronological Ordering
│
├── No → Is it about maximizing non-overlapping intervals?
│   ├── Yes → Sort by End Time
│   │   └── Use Greedy approach to select earliest ending intervals
│   │
│   └── No → Is it about merging or finding intersections?
│       ├── Yes → Sort by Start Time
│       │   └── Use Two-Pointer technique if needed
│       │
│       └── No → Is it about scheduling with deadlines?
│           ├── Yes → Use Priority Queue with custom comparator
│           └── No → Consider other approaches based on specific requirements
