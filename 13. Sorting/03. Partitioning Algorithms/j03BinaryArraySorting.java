/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * 
 *      Given a binary array (containing only 0s and 1s), sort the array such that all 0s appear 
 *      before all 1s. The relative order of elements is not required to be maintained.
 * 
 * Input:
 *     - An integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5), representing the size of the array.
 *     - An array `arr` of size `n` where each element satisfies arr[i] âˆˆ {0, 1}.
 * 
 * Output:
 *     - A rearranged version of the array such that all 0s come before all 1s.
 * 
 * Example:
 *     Input:
 *         Enter the size of the array: 7
 *         Enter the elements of the array: 1 0 1 1 0 0 1
 *     Output:
 *         Sorted array: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
 * 
 *     Explanation:
 *         The 0s are moved to the left: [0, 0, 0], and the 1s are moved to the right: [1, 1, 1, 1].
 *         The relative order of elements is not preserved.

    /**
     * Approach: Two Pointer Technique
     * 
     * Intuition:
     * - The problem can be visualized as partitioning the array into two groups:
     *   one group containing only 0s and the other containing only 1s.
     * - Using two pointers, `left` and `right`, traverse the array from left to right:
     *   - If a 0 is encountered, it is swapped to the current position of `left`, and 
     *     `left` is incremented.
     *   - If a 1 is encountered, simply increment `right` without making changes.
     * - This ensures all 0s are grouped at the beginning and 1s at the end.
     * 
     * Why This Works:
     * - The `left` pointer keeps track of the position where the next 0 should be placed.
     * - The `right` pointer traverses the array, ensuring all elements are checked.
     * 
     * Time Complexity:
     * - O(n): Each element is processed once.
     * 
     * Space Complexity:
     * - O(1): The sorting is performed in place without requiring additional memory.
     * 
     * @param arr The binary array to be sorted.
