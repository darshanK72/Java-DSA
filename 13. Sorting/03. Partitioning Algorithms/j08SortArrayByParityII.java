/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * 
 *     Given an array `nums` of integers, sort it such that:
 *     - All even numbers are at the even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
 *     - All odd numbers are at the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).
 * 
 * Input:
 *     - An integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5), representing the size of the array.
 *     - An array `nums` of size `n` where each element satisfies (âˆ’10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5) and `nums[i]` is either even or odd.
 * 
 * Output:
 *     - The array where even elements are at even indices and odd elements are at odd indices.
 * 
 * Example:
 *     Input:
 *     4
 *     [4, 2, 5, 7]
 *     Output:
 *     [4, 5, 2, 7]
 * 
 *     Explanation:
 *     - The even numbers (4, 2) are placed at indices 0 and 2, respectively.
 *     - The odd numbers (5, 7) are placed at indices 1 and 3, respectively.

    /**
     * Approach: Sorting Array by Parity with Two Pointers
     * 
     * Intuition:
     * - We need to arrange even and odd elements at specific indices.
     * - We will use two pointers:
     *   - `k` to place even elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
     *   - `l` to place odd elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).
     * - The idea is to iterate through the array and place the elements directly at their respective positions.
     * 
     * Time Complexity:
     * - O(n): We iterate through the array once.
     * 
     * Space Complexity:
     * - O(n): We use an extra array to store the result.
     * 
     * @param nums The input array of integers.
     * @return The array sorted by parity, where even numbers are at even indices and odd numbers are at odd indices.
