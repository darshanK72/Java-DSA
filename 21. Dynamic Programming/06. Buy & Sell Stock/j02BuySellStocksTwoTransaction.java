/**
 * LeetCode 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III
 * 
 * Problem Statement:
 *     You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a
 *     given stock on the i-th day. Find the maximum profit you can achieve.
 *     You may complete at most two transactions.
 *     Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously
 *     (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 * 
 * Input:
 *     - prices (0 <= prices.length <= 10^5, 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5)
 * 
 * Output:
 *     - Maximum profit as an integer with at most two transactions
 * 
 * Example:
 *     Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
 *     Output: 6
 * 
 *     Explanation:
 *     Buy on day 3 (price=0) and sell on day 6 (price=3), profit = 3.
 *     Then buy on day 7 (price=1) and sell on day 8 (price=4), profit = 3.
 *     Total profit = 6.

     * Approach 1: Two-Pass Split DP (Prefix + Suffix Best Profits)
     * 
     * Intuition:
     * - The best total profit with at most two transactions can be realized by
     *   splitting the timeline at some index i: make at most one transaction
     *   in the prefix [0..i] and at most one in the suffix [i..n-1]. The
     *   optimal answer is the maximum over all i of prefixBest[i] + suffixBest[i].
     * - We can compute these two arrays in linear time: a forward pass tracks
     *   the minimum price so far to compute the best single-transaction
     *   profit up to each day; a backward pass tracks the maximum future price
     *   to compute the best single-transaction profit from each day onward.
     * 
     * Explanation:
     * - Forward pass builds buy[i]: best profit achievable within [0..i].
     *   Maintain running min of prices; potential profit at day i is
     *   prices[i] - minSoFar. Take max with previous best.
     * - Backward pass builds sell[i]: best profit achievable within [i..n-1].
     *   Maintain running max to the right; potential profit buying at i and
     *   selling later is maxRight - prices[i]. Take max with previous best.
     * - Combine: answer is max over i of buy[i] + sell[i]. This allows the two
     *   transactions to reside entirely in the prefix, entirely in the suffix,
     *   or one on each side of i, without overlap.
     * 
     * Time Complexity: O(n) — two linear passes plus a final combine pass.
     * Space Complexity: O(n) — arrays buy and sell of length n.
     * 
     * @param prices    Array of daily prices (null/empty -> 0 profit)
     * @return          Maximum profit with at most two transactions

    /**
     * Approach 2: DP + Memoization (Top-Down)
     * 
     * Intuition:
     * - Treat the trading process as a finite state machine driven by three
     *   variables: day index, whether we are currently holding a share, and how
     *   many sales (transactions) we can still make. A transaction is defined
     *   as a buy followed by a sell; to avoid double-counting, we decrement the
     *   transaction counter only on a sell. This convention ensures that a
     *   partially executed transaction (after a buy) does not prematurely
     *   reduce the budget for future opportunities.
     * - Optimal substructure: the best profit from any state depends only on
     *   the best profits of the next day’s states. Greedy choices (always buy
     *   or sell when local condition holds) fail because two transactions may
     *   interact across non-adjacent days; DP captures these dependencies.
     * - Overlapping subproblems: many states recur (e.g., the same remaining
     *   k and holding flag at different paths). Memoization avoids exponential
     *   recomputation and collapses the search to linear in time.
     * 
     * Explanation:
     * - Define state f(index, holding, k) as the maximum achievable profit
     *   from day index ... n-1 given whether we currently hold a share and how
     *   many sells remain. Transitions:
     *     * holding == 0: max( buy today -> -price[index] + f(index+1,1,k),
     *                       skip today -> f(index+1,0,k) )
     *     * holding == 1: max( sell today -> +price[index] + f(index+1,0,k-1),
     *                       hold today -> f(index+1,1,k) )
     * - Base cases: if index == n (no more days) or k == 0 (no sells left),
     *   profit is 0 because we cannot realize further gains.
     * - Memoize results in dp[k][holding][index] to ensure each state is
     *   computed once. This yields linear time in the number of days.
     * 
     * Time Complexity: O(n * 2 * 3) states, O(1) work per state -> O(n)
     * Space Complexity: O(n * 2 * 3) for memo + O(n) recursion stack depth
     * 
     * @param prices    Non-null array of prices; empty treated as zero profit
     * @return          Maximum profit with at most two transactions

     *   state variables (k, holding, index). Because decisions on day index
     *   depend only on index+1, a backward pass naturally respects data
     *   dependencies and avoids recursion.
     * 
     * Explanation:
     * - Initialize an extra sentinel day n with zeros (no time left => 0).
     *   For each index from n-1 down to 0 and for each (holding, k>0), compute
     *   the max of acting vs. not acting using already filled values at index+1.
     *   Selling references k-1 because a sale completes one transaction.
     * - The answer we seek is dp[2][0][0]: at day 0, not holding, with two
     *   sells remaining.
