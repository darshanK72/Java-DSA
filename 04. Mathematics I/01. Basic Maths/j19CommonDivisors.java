/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * 
 *     Given two integers `a` and `b`, find the number of common divisors between the two numbers.
 *     A divisor of a number is any integer that divides the number exactly (without remainder). 
 *     The task is to find how many numbers are divisors of both `a` and `b`.
 * 
 * Input:
 *     - Two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
 * 
 * Output:
 *     - An integer representing the number of common divisors of `a` and `b`.
 * 
 * Example:
 *     Input:
 *     12 18
 *     Output:
 *     6
 * 
 *     Explanation:
 *     The divisors of 12 are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12].
 *     The divisors of 18 are [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18].
 *     The common divisors are [1, 2, 3, 6].
 *     Therefore, the output is 4.

     * - If it divides both numbers, count it as a common divisor.
