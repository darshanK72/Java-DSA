/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * 
 *     A **perfect number** is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.
 *     For example, 28 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14, and their sum is 28.
 * 
 *     The task is to determine if a given integer `n` is a perfect number.
 * 
 * Input:
 *     - A single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^8).
 * 
 * Output:
 *     - Output `true` if the number is perfect, and `false` otherwise.
 * 
 * Example:
 *     Input:
 *     28
 *     Output:
 *     true
 * 
 *     Explanation:
 *     The divisors of 28 are [1, 2, 4, 7, 14], and their sum is 28.
 *     Therefore, 28 is a perfect number.

     * Approach 1: Brute Force Approach to Check if a Number is Perfect
     * 
     * Intuition:
     * - A number is perfect if the sum of its proper divisors (divisors excluding the number itself) is equal to the number.
     * - For each number from 1 to the square root of the given number, check if it is a divisor, and add both the divisor and quotient.
     * 
     * Time Complexity:
     * - O(âˆšn), where `n` is the given number, as we only iterate up to the square root of `n` to find divisors.
     * 
     * Space Complexity:
     * - O(1), as only a few variables are used to store the sum and iterate through divisors.
     * 
     * @param num The number to check for perfection.
     * @return true if the number is perfect, false otherwise.
