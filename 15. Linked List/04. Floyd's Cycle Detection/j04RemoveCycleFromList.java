/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * 
 *      Given a linked list, detect and remove the cycle if it exists.
 *      If there is no cycle, the linked list remains unchanged.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 *      - The linked list may contain multiple nodes.
 *      - The cycle can start at any position.
 * 
 * Input:
 *      - A reference to the head of a linked list.
 * 
 * Output:
 *      - The linked list without a cycle.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 *     Input:  1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 (cycle)
 *     Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> null

     * Approach 1: HashSet Method (Detect & Remove Cycle)
     * 
     * Intuition:
     * - Uses a HashSet to store visited nodes.
     * - If a node is visited again, a cycle is detected.
     * - Remove the cycle by setting the previous node's `next` pointer to `null`.
     * 
     * Explanation:
     * 1. Traverse the linked list while storing each node in a HashSet.
     * 2. If a node's `next` pointer is already in the HashSet, a cycle is detected.
     * 3. Break the cycle by setting `temp.next = null`.
     * 
     * Time Complexity: O(N) - Each node is visited once.
     * Space Complexity: O(N) - HashSet stores up to N nodes.
     * 
     * @param head The head of the linked list.

     * 
     * Intuition:
     * - Uses slow and fast pointers to detect a cycle.
     * - Once a cycle is detected, find the starting node of the cycle.
     * - Traverse to the last node in the cycle and remove it by setting `next = null`.
     * 
     * Explanation:
     * 1. Detect if a cycle exists using slow & fast pointers.
     * 2. If a cycle exists, find the starting node of the cycle.
     * 3. Traverse the cycle until reaching the last node and remove the cycle.
     * 
     * Time Complexity: O(N) - Each node is visited at most twice.
     * Space Complexity: O(1) - Uses only two pointers.
