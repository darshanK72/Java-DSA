I am solving problems using java on leetcode and geeksforgeeks and learning DSA, i have maintain a 
code repository where I am maintaining java code files, I want to format that files in above structure as it is, indentention will be also as it is from file, also multiline comments will have 
to be same with /** start.

if there is only on approach for that problem then give heading as Approach. if there are some more approaches present for that problem then please provide from your side with same format given.

Try to get problem statement from leetcode or Geeksforgeeks where yo can find, where you cannot find create a problem statement based on given input code.

Now remember this for each and every promt I will provide in this conversation, start giving your output from my next promt.
if there are any efficient approach or any other approach present for question, then also provide it from your side in same format

The intuition should be explained properly, if we are implementing certain logic, then why we are doing that should also be explained in intuition

if there are multiple solutions or approaches for problem, then arrange them from worst to best

wrap comments ,follow proper alignment, wrap text for general vs code code editor windowa
