# Definition of Algorithm

The word Algorithm means ”A set of finite rules or instructions to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations” or ”A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves recursive operations”. Therefore, an Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.

## Need for Algorithms

Algorithms are necessary for solving complex problems efficiently and effectively. They:
- Help automate processes, making them more reliable, faster, and easier to perform.
- Enable computers to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do manually.
- Find application in various fields such as mathematics, computer science, engineering, finance, etc., to optimize processes, analyze data, make predictions, and provide solutions to problems.

## Characteristics of an Algorithm

An algorithm must possess the following characteristics:

1. **Clear and Unambiguous:** Each step should be clear and lead to only one meaning, avoiding ambiguity.
2. **Well-Defined Inputs:** Inputs, if any, should be well-defined, and the algorithm may or may not take input.
3. **Well-Defined Outputs:** The output must be clearly defined, producing at least one output.
4. **Finiteness:** The algorithm should terminate after a finite time, avoiding infinite processes.
5. **Feasible:** It should be simple, practical, and executable with available resources, avoiding dependency on future technologies.
6. **Language Independent:** Designed to be language-independent, the algorithm should yield the same output regardless of the programming language.
7. **Input and Output:** Zero or more inputs and at least one output should be present.
8. **Definiteness:** Instructions should be unambiguous, precise, and easy to interpret.
9. **Effectiveness:** Developed using basic, simple, and feasible operations, allowing tracing using paper and pencil.

Each characteristic ensures the algorithm's effectiveness, clarity, and practicality in solving problems.
