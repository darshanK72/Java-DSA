# What is Data Structure?

## Definition
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and updated effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks.

## Classification of Data Structure

### Linear Data Structure
A linear data structure arranges data elements sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements.
#### Characteristics
- **Sequential Organization:** Elements are arranged sequentially, with a unique predecessor and successor.
- **Order Preservation:** Maintains the order of elements when added or removed.
- **Fixed or Dynamic Size:** Can have fixed (e.g., arrays) or dynamic sizes (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues).
- **Efficient Access:** Provides efficient element access (e.g., constant-time access in arrays).

#### Examples
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks (Last-In-First-Out)
- Queues (First-In-First-Out)

### Non-linear Data Structure
Non-linear data structures don't place data elements sequentially or linearly. They represent relationships where elements can connect to multiple elements or nodes.
#### Characteristics
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Elements can have multiple connections forming trees or graphs.
- **No Sequential Order:** Elements may not have a clear predecessor or successor.
- **Complex Relationships:** Enables complex relationships between elements.
- **Dynamic Nature:** Can dynamically change size and structure.

#### Examples
- Trees (hierarchical structures with parent-child relationships)
- Graphs (nodes interconnected by edges)

### Static Data Structure
A static data structure has a fixed memory size and easier element access. Example: Array.

### Dynamic Data Structure
A dynamic data structure allows resizing during runtime, optimizing memory space. Examples: Queue, Stack, etc.

# Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a theoretical concept in computer science that defines a set of data values and operations on those values without specifying the implementation details. It focuses on describing the operations that can be performed on the data and the constraints and rules governing these operations.

ADTs are abstract in nature as they provide a logical description of data behavior while hiding the underlying implementation details. They encapsulate data structures and operations, enabling users to work with the data without requiring in-depth knowledge of its internal workings.

### Example: Stack ADT

**Data:** A stack is a collection of elements with two primary operations: push (adding an element) and pop (removing an element).

**Behavior:** Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.

Implementations of a stack can vary—using arrays, linked lists, or other data structures—but from an abstract perspective, users interact with the stack through its defined operations (push and pop) without needing to understand the internal execution details.

### Benefits of ADTs

- **Abstraction:** Users can focus on utilizing data without dealing with implementation complexities.
- **Encapsulation:** Internal details are concealed, enhancing security and preventing unintended changes.
- **Modularity:** ADTs enable modular programming by separating the interface (methods) from the implementation, facilitating easier maintenance and updates.

Common examples of ADTs encompass stacks, queues, lists, trees, and graphs. These abstract concepts serve as foundational elements for designing algorithms and constructing more complex data structures in various programming languages.
