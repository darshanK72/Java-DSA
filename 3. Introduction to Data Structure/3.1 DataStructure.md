# What is Data Structure?

## Definition
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and updated effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks.

## Classification of Data Structure

### Linear Data Structure
A linear data structure arranges data elements sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements.
#### Characteristics
- **Sequential Organization:** Elements are arranged sequentially, with a unique predecessor and successor.
- **Order Preservation:** Maintains the order of elements when added or removed.
- **Fixed or Dynamic Size:** Can have fixed (e.g., arrays) or dynamic sizes (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues).
- **Efficient Access:** Provides efficient element access (e.g., constant-time access in arrays).

#### Examples
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks (Last-In-First-Out)
- Queues (First-In-First-Out)

### Non-linear Data Structure
Non-linear data structures don't place data elements sequentially or linearly. They represent relationships where elements can connect to multiple elements or nodes.
#### Characteristics
- **Hierarchical Organization:** Elements can have multiple connections forming trees or graphs.
- **No Sequential Order:** Elements may not have a clear predecessor or successor.
- **Complex Relationships:** Enables complex relationships between elements.
- **Dynamic Nature:** Can dynamically change size and structure.

#### Examples
- Trees (hierarchical structures with parent-child relationships)
- Graphs (nodes interconnected by edges)

### Static Data Structure
A static data structure has a fixed memory size and easier element access. Example: Array.

### Dynamic Data Structure
A dynamic data structure allows resizing during runtime, optimizing memory space. Examples: Queue, Stack, etc.
